# Computer Graphics Final Project
# By: Ben Pan and Vernon Hughes

## List of MDL Commands
- [X] frames
- [X] vary
- [X] basename
- [X] mesh
- [X] camera
- [X] light
- [X] ambient
- [X] supersampling (custom command - takes one integer argument for the scale of supersampling)

## Features
- [X] Animation
- [X] Import mesh from OBJ files with MTL file integration
- [X] Phong shading model
- [X] Supersampling/Anti-Aliasing

Note: To produce our gif for the gallery we used 50 frames and a supersampling scale
of 2, but the mdl file provided for the "make" command will create 20 frames
with a supersampling scale of 1 (no anti-aliasing) in order to run faster. These values
can be adjusted in the file 'gallery.mdl'.
